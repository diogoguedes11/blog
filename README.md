# GA roadmap.sh project

This is a basic GitHub Actions workflow project that demonstrates how to automatically deploy static content to GitHub Pages. 

The workflow is triggered when changes are made to the `index.html` file and automatically deploys the updated website to GitHub Pages using continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) principles.

**Project URL:** https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow

## What this project does:
- Automatically deploys static HTML content to GitHub Pages
- Uses GitHub Actions for continuous deployment
- Triggers deployment only when `index.html` is modified
- Provides hands-on experience with CI/CD workflows
